# log-it

Simple CLI daily logger with some basic features. In fact, I created it for personal use, but I will be glad if anyone finds it useful.

## How it works

The program is designed to keep track of the passing days. By asking the user specific questions, it creates a record that contains the following data:

ID | DATE | LINE | TIME | SCORE
-- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -----

- ID - for internal usage only
- DATE - date of the record
- LINE - short entry describing the day 
- TIME - time spent productively
- SCORE - overall score of the day

## What can do

- Add logs for any choosen day
- View previously added logs
- View logs with specific time/score
- View overall statistic
